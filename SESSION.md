## Game Details
- **Title**: Frequency Shift
- **Genre**: Musical Puzzle / Rhythm Experience
- **Story/Lore**: In the year 2847, the Harmonic Engine—a device that could translate emotion into music—went silent. The great resonance towers that once sang with the collective feelings of humanity now stand dormant. You are a Frequency Shifter, trained to reignite the Engine by manipulating raw waveforms and restoring harmony to a world that has forgotten the sound of joy.
- **Core Mechanic**: Players manipulate a traveling waveform by tapping to place resonance nodes. Nodes split and modify the waveform, creating harmonics. Match frequencies to collect notes.
- **Tech Stack**: Three.js 0.158.0, Tone.js 14.8.49

## Concepts Generated
1. **Void Cascade** - Physics puzzle where orbs reveal hidden geometry in a cascading void
2. **Frequency Shift** - Musical puzzle with waveform manipulation (SELECTED)
3. **Graviton Golf** - Mini-golf with multi-body gravity physics

## Notes
- Sub-agent spawning was not available in this session, so all steps were completed directly by the game-producer agent
- Fixed Three.js CDN URL from r158 to 0.158.0 (404 error)
- Fixed Tone.js audio initialization errors
- Browser testing done with openclaw browser
- Game features: waveform visualization, harmonic matching, combo system, difficulty progression

## Conversations
(No sub-agents were spawned due to tool limitations. All work completed directly.)
